---
InsecureShop is an Android application that is designed to be intentionally vulnerable. The application serves as a platform to test your Android pentesting skills. The vulnerabilities present in this app are real and have been found during mobile pentests.

## ⚙️ Usage

You can compile the source code in Android Studio or simply download the APK file from [here](https://github.com/hax0rgb/InsecureShop/releases)

## 📌 Note:

* Majority of the vulnerabilities can be exploited on a non-rooted device (Threat Actors - Remote users and Malicious third-party applications)
* No API's being used by the app.

## ❗️Vulnerabilities:

1. **Hardcoded Credentials:** Credentials are hardcoded somewhere that can be used to login to the application
2. **Insufficient URL Validation:** Possible to load any arbitrary URL in webview via Deeplink.
3. **Weak Host Validation Check:** Possible to bypass host validation check to load any arbitrary URL in webview.
4. **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Arbitrary Code Execution via third-party package contexts.
5. **Access to Protected Components:** The app takes an embedded Intent and passes it to method like startActivity. This allows any third party app to launch any protected component.
6. **Unprotected Data URIs:** The untrusted URI's passed via loadUrl method allows attackers to pass arbitrary URL in webview.
7. **Theft of Arbitrary:** Possible to steal files from app's local storage via ChooserActivity.
8. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:** Identify the vulnerable components or libraries used in the app that can allow you to exfiltrate local files to remote domain.
9. **Insecure Broadcast Receiver:** An exported activity registers a broadcast during onCreate method execution. An attacker can trigger this broadcast and provide arbitrary URL in 'web_url' parameter.
10. **AWS Cognito Misconfiguration:** The misconfigured AWS cognito instance can be used to accesss AWS S3 bucket.
11. **Insecure use of FilePaths in FileProvider:** The use of wide file sharing declaration can be used to access root directory via content Provider.
12. **Use of Implicit intent to send a broadcast with sensitive data:** The use of Implicit intent can allow third-party apps to steal credentials.
13. **Intercepting Implicit intent to load arbitrary URL:** The use of Implicit intent can allow third-party apps to load any arbitrary URL in webview.
14. **Insecure Implementation of SetResult in exported Activity:** The insecure implementation used in ResultActivity can be used to access arbitrary content providers.
15. **Insecure Content Provider:** The content provider can be accessed by any third-party app to steal user credentials.
16. **Lack of SSL Certificate Validation:** The unsafe implementation of OnReceived SSL Error can be used to eavesdrop all the traffic loaded in webview.
17. **Insecure Webview Properties Enabled:** Insecure Webview properties are enabled that can allow third-party apps to exfiltrate local data to remote domain.
18. **Insecure Data Storage:** The app stores user credentials locally without encrypting them.
19. **Insecure Logging:** User credentials are leaked in logcat. Only attackers with physical access to the device can access this information.
